# Overview
This project aims to show that basic machine learning algorithms can be viable
for object classification.

## Features
One aspect of this project will be to examine the use of mutliple types of image features. Currently, SIFT and SURF features are popular in the machine learning and computer vision fields. The list of features that will be evaluated is given below.
- GIST
- SURF
- SIFT
- HOG

## Algorithms
This project will also evaluate the viability of several basic machine learning algorithms. Permutations of feature descriptors and basic algorithms will be evaluated for accuracy. Efficiency will also be discussed, though it will not impact the evaluation of these algorithms. The list of algorithms that will be evaluated is given below.
- KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)

# Why Not Use CNNs?
CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are widely held to be the kings of object detection and classification. However, we believe that they are much more complicated to architect and set up. We would like to focus on displaying the power of basic algorithms combined with good feature selection and tuning.
